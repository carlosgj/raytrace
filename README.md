Shanti's Raytracer: fast, precise, and accurate optical ray propagation

Start with "examples.m" and read the instructions in "raytrace.m".

To see how one might instantiate a giant segmented telescope, and compute the effect on the pupil-referred wavefront if any of the optical elements were to move a microradian or micrometer in any direction, run "exampleHabEx.m".

The [MATLAB](matlab/) code was originally developed at JPL, and is released as open-source under an [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE). US Government sponsorship is acknowledged.
